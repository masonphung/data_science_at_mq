The repo contains some of my assignment work at the Master in Data Science, Macquarie University, which includes:
- Quarto/RMarkdown compiled reports of Statistical Analysis/Testing and Linear model analysis.
- Processing Big Data using Python & MapReduce
- Deep learning and text processing techniques using Tensorflow, Keras and NLTK.

Please note that the actual courses actually cover many other topics as well as  weekly practical work & assignment.
